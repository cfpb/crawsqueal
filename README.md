## Usage

```
npx cfpb/crawsqueal
```

It'll create a SQLite database named `./cfgov.sqlite3`, crawl the cf.gov website, and create a record for every page that has a unique URL (including query params and hashes). Takes a couple hours. You can optionally pass a custom filename for the database, e.g. `npx cfpb/crawsqueal db.sqlite3`.

FYI [DB4S](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser) is a neat SQLite browser.

## Development

```
yarn
yarn start
```
